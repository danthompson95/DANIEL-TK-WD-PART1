# DANIEL-TK-WD-PART1

## CSS naming
I chose to name each article after a numbered section on how they would appear on the page. From here I was able to specify within each section where a component belonged.

## Syntax
I use camelcase for files and js items, as well as ID on html pieces. For classes on css I use connecting hyphens.

## Mobile and Desktop
Designed for desktop and works in mobile also.

## Compatibility
Checked in Firefox, Chrome, IE11, Edge and Opera. Unable to test Safari as no devices on hand to test that.
